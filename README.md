# dom_repl
A lightweight, simple, probably badly insecure embeddable JS repl for the browser DOM.  ES6 typescript

## Why would you even want this
I know, right?

But I want to teach javascript, and I feel like it'll be a lot easier if there's a little console they can use underneath the videos

Besides it's weird and fun

## But... everything about this is bad
Standard open source dodge: "it's open source.  You fix it."

## Whose fault is this
Mine, but, if we're at finger pointing tier, [this guy started it](https://gist.github.com/tlrobinson/1261720).
